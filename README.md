# Sort-Manager
A repository to store files and folders relating to the Sort Manager I built using Java.

After a period of two weeks at Sparta Global, where we were taught Java, we were assigned a project where we would have to individually build a 'Sort Manager' application.

This was an application that combined various different sorting algorithms (e.g. Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, etc.). Each of these algorithms would randomly generate an array, allowing the user to input their own choice on the amount of elements inside the array, sort that random array and they time how long each algorithm took to run and compile, to test which algorithm was the faster and which was the slowest.

Specifically, the following algorithms were included:

1) Bubble Sort
2) Merge Sort (Recursive)
3) Quick Sort (Recursive)
4) Insertion Sort
5) Selection Sort
6) Binary Tree Sort

This project tested my abilities and knowledge of Java concepts. The most prominent of these concepts being OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and its four principles (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism). In addition, S.O.L.I.D and its 5 principles were also applied.

Included is a folder, which contains all of the Java files that I coded onto (including the Main file, which is was starts the program).
